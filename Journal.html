<h1>My Trip Around the USA on a Segway</h1>
Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!

<p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
through some interesting places on the way: 
<ol>
<li>Walla Walla, WA</li> 
<li>Magic City, ID</li> 
<li>Bountiful, UT</li> 
<li>Last Chance, CO</li> 
<li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
<li>Why, AZ</li> 
</ol></p>

<p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
<q>Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity.</q>
I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>

<h2>June 2, 2012</h2>
<p>My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: 
<ul>
<li>cellphone</li> 
<li>iPod</li> 
<li>digital camera</li> 
<li>and a protein bar</li></ul>
Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q></p>
