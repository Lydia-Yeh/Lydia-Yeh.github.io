<h1>(Lydia) Chin-Yi Yeh</h1>
<p>E-mail: luvmrt1005@gmail.com</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I was a new media marketing specialist with over one year of experience in web and app promotions, campaigns and improvement.  Previously I worked in a multinational start-up with Lifestyle app for iOS and Android, being responsible for company's membership growth and traffic growth.  Currently I work as a part-time UX/product researcher, trying to expand my career path.</p>

In my first job, I put most of my efforts on client marketing projects and new function promotions (especially the one regards a new payment method) at that time.  I have planned the entire campaign structures and monitored the progress of them.  I am able to refine original ideas given by my manager, and strengthen the social brand communication.  As for my second job, I work closely with the product team, planning and conducting user experience surveys according to their objectives in target countries.  Although it is not a permanent job, the experience from it has provided me with a more complete view in product planning process.

Now I am looking forward to build up more (tech) product planning experiences.  I would like to find a permanent job regarding product planning as my third job and keep staying in this fast-changing Internet industry.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have a suitable vacancy in (junior) product manager, web/app planner, UX researcher or digital marketing specialist.</p>
